# Class Extras
CLASS:VAR|Class.MaxLevel		EXPLANATION:This sets the Maximum Level on the Class - this is a local var and may be used on each class to have a Maxmimum defined level. CONVERSION NOTE: This should replace 'MAXLEVEL' see discussion below:
# Tom Discussion:  MAXLEVEL can be a local var to each class, thats a tag we can remove
# [20:49] Tom Parker: maybe
# [20:49] Tom Parker: the code needs to know about it today though
# [20:49] Andrew: it controls the maxlevel of any given class, can be replaced with a PREBOOL
# [20:50] Tom Parker: maybe
# [20:50] Tom Parker: The one thing we're going to have to watch out for is usability
# [20:50] Tom Parker: right now it produces an error message about max levels being reached
# [20:50] Tom Parker: with PREBOOL it would say not qualified, a more general error
# [20:50] Andrew: I wouldn't know, never maxed out before. 
# [20:50] Tom Parker: so PREBOOL may need an explanation or some such attached to it somehow
# [20:52] Andrew: hm
# [20:52] Tom Parker: The problem there becomes translation
# [20:52] Andrew: newtag to display a message then, so we avoid those for now.
# [20:52] Tom Parker: we don't want it to be on PREBOOL itself
# [20:53] Tom Parker: more like PREBOOL:REASON1|...formula...
# [20:53] Tom Parker: and then REASON1 is the index of some sort to get the actual string
# [20:53] Andrew: Ah, that sounds good
# [20:53] Tom Parker: that's more of an i18n question that we will want to solve consistently with that plan
# [20:54] Andrew: i18n - yeah

# MODIFYOTHER:ABILITY=Archetype|GROUP=FighterWeaponMastery|FighterWeaponMastery|SET|True
# Global set to one if the flag is turned on
# MODIFY:ABILITYPOOL=Weapon Mastery|SET|if(context("FLAG",FighterWeaponMastery),1,0)


#GLOBAL:ABILITYPOOL|Weapon Mastery
ABILITYPOOL|Weapon Mastery		EXPLANATION:Sets up ABILITYPOOL "Weapon Mastery"
#In effect the following puts the flag on all Abilities of the given Group
# Other items could set the flag individually even if they are not an Archetype


#################
# Note that this method of having separate SETs on each object is probably preferable to calling a count() function as you showed... it will resolve a lot faster, since it will deterministically know the SET had no effect on the results if it's already True.  A count() would have to be checked each time to see if new Abilities were added to the PC, so it will be a lot slower.
# I'd note as well that the FLAG concept then can replace a lot of your variables that you change from 0 to 1 and use a TYPE= controlled bonus to ensure that multiple grants can't ever make it more than one (in case you need to decrement it back to zero).  You're hacking integers to do a Boolean function and the new system allows you to really, truly, use a Boolean because that is what you are really doing... and just have a higher priority if you need to force it back to FALSE.
# Power and clarity... good things.
#####################



#On PRExxx:

#PREBOOL:context("AREA",Face==5,5)
#PREBOOL:context("x",yz)
# x = valid defined VARTYPE
# y = Define Value in the designated VARTYPE
# z = any valid formula symbol and value
# <   Less Than
# >   Greater Than
# =>  Greater Than or Equal to
# <=  Less Than or Equal to
# ==  Is equal to
# !=  Is not equal to
# &&  ?

#context drops into "AREA" and then you run a Boolean comparison for Face equaling 5,5... if the Boolean returns TRUE the PRExxx passes, if not, then not.
#This can then capture ANYTHING in the formula environment just by writing it as a Boolean formula... and with functions like count() and others that will undoubtedly be created, you may find yourself liking to use PREBOOL rather than other PRExxx

# Equipment:
EQUIPMENT.PART:CritMult			EXPLANATION:Sets up Equipment to have "CritMult" which sets a Critical Multiplier value for each part of the equipment (FORMAT: #/xY, with Y the value). (In d20, a weapon may have Two "Heads" and have unique values for either head.
EQUIPMENT.PART:CritRange		EXPLANATION:Sets up Equipment to have "CritRange" which sets a Critical Range value for each part of the equipment (FORMAT: Y/x#, with Y being a 20, 19-20, 18-20, etc.) (In d20, a weapon may have Two "Heads" and have unique values for either head.
EQUIPMENT:WT				EXPLANATION:Equipment may only have one Weight, abbreviated "WT" for fast use.
EQUIPMENT:COST				EXPLANATION:Equipment may have one Cost or "Price".

# Skill is a LOCAL designation, it does not have "PART". A Single Skill is composed of the following components:
# Rank, Bonus, Stat, and Total. This matches our output display
SKILL|Rank		EXPLANATION:Each skill has a 'Rank' that is increased for a skill point pool
SKILL|Bonus		EXPLANATION:Each skill has a 'Bonus' modifier displayed on the Sheet - 
SKILL|Stat		EXPLANATION:Each skill has a 'Stat' that modifies it's final value
SKILL|Total		EXPLANATION:Each skill has a 'Total' value

# Stat is an interesting value - KEYSTAT: determines what is display, however, some classes alter which stat is used. OS should have a method to alter this display.


# Bonus "Types" we need to track
SKILL|Bonus.Morale
SKILL|Bonus.Competence
SKILL|Bonus.Enhancement
SKILL|Bonus.Trait
SKILL|Bonus.Class			EXPLANATION:Class is for Pathfinder - it grants a +3 to the skill IF the skill is designated as a class skill
